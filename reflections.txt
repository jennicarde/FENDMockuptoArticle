Your response goes here!
1. Paths are something I struggle with, so helped me start to wrap my head around it. Also, using figure and figcaption tags. I knew of them, but I don’t really think about using them.
2. Recreating the document was the easiest.
3. Doing the relative path was most difficult. Also, I always forget the image alt tag.
4. Oh, let’s see, at first I couldn’t get the Udacity Feedback Extension to work because I had set it up months ago. When I had set it up before, I didn’t select “Allow access to file URLs” in the Extension. I had to review the docs to find that one thing I was missing. I new it worked else where - i.e. on the web, so I knew that it wasn’t allowing access to my local drive for some reason. That was fun. ;)
